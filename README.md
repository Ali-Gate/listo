## Project Planning


### **User Flow Diagram**

### **Overview**
The User Flow Diagram illustrates the path users take through the Listo! app, from initial landing to task management. It shows the key decision points, actions, and system responses that create a seamless user experience. The diagram highlights both authenticated and non-authenticated user paths, as well as core task management functionalities.

![responsivenes_screenviews](static\images\planning\UserFlowDiagram.png)


### **Wireframes**

### **Wireframe Planning**
My initial wireframes were hand-drawn to quickly visualize the layout and user interface across different devices. These sketches helped plan the responsive design and essential features before development. The wireframes show the core elements like navigation, task lists, and forms optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile views.

**Desktop**

### **Data Models**

**Entity Relational Diagram**

![Entity Relational Diagram](static\images\planning\ERD.PNG)


### Task model class 
The association between users and tasks ensures privacy and personalization.
This connection allows for tailored task management features, such as personalized notifications. By maintaining this association, the app can provide a more organized and efficient task management experience, enhancing overall user satisfaction.

### User  model class
The User entity represents individuals who Sign Up and interact with the Listo! app. 
Each user has unique attributes such as a username, email, and password, ensuring secure access and personalized task management. 
This association allows users to manage their tasks independently, maintaining privacy and organization, while also enabling features like personalized notifications and progress tracking.


### Task Form model class (forms.py)
The association between tasks and task forms ensures structured data entry and consistency in task management.
This relationship helps maintain the integrity of task information and provides a user-friendly way to input and update task details.

# Views and Templates

## Overview

The app's interface is built using a collection of Django views and templates that work together to create a seamless user experience. Each view handles specific functionality, from task management to user authentication, while templates provide the visual structure and layout.

Key views include:
- Home view for landing page
- Authentication views for login/signup
- Task management views (list, create, edit, delete)
- Admin views for system management

Templates are designed to be fully responsive across devices while maintaining consistent styling and functionality. The interface prioritizes intuitive navigation and clear task management workflows.

### Base.html

The container for all of our html content is provided by base.html which holds all of the other views for a seamless and consistent user experience. Styling had been skillfully adjusted so that all the views present a harmonic layout against the basic structure.

# JavaScript Implementation

The JavaScript in this application serves two main purposes:

1. Action Feedback Messages
- Displays temporary notification messages after user actions
- Uses setTimeout for automatic message dismissal
- Provides visual feedback for task creation, updates, and deletions

2. Past Due Date Modal
- Triggers when user attempts to create a task with a past due date
- Implements confirmation dialog with Yes/No options
- Validates date inputs before task creation
- Uses Bootstrap's modal component for consistent UI

The JavaScript code is kept minimal and focused on essential user interaction feedback, enhancing the core Django-based functionality without overcomplicating the frontend.

# Debugging and Testing

Throughout the development process, rigorous debugging and testing were conducted to ensure the application's reliability and functionality. This involved both manual testing approaches to identify and resolve issues across different aspects of the application as well as online validation tools.

Key testing areas included:
- User authentication flows
- Task management operations
- Form validations
- Database interactions
- UI/UX responsiveness
- Error handling mechanisms

Debug tools and methodologies used:
- Terminal's problems tab
- Console logging
- Browser DevTools
- Manual test cases
- Cross-browser testing


## Manual Testing

Manual testing was conducted systematically across all features and user flows to ensure functionality, usability, and responsiveness. Each feature was tested multiple times under different conditions and user states (logged in/out) to verify expected behavior and identify potential issues.

The testing process included:
- Feature-by-feature verification
- User authentication flows
- Form validations and submissions
- Error handling and messaging
- Cross-device compatibility
- Navigation and routing
- Data persistence

Below is a detailed breakdown of the test cases and their results:

### Responsiveness Testing

Extensive responsiveness testing was conducted using Chrome DevTools' device simulation features to ensure optimal display and functionality across different screen sizes and devices. The testing focused on layout integrity, readability, and user interaction elements at various breakpoints.

Key aspects tested included:
- Locating origin of code and often over-riding external resources
- Navigation menu behavior
- Content scaling and alignment
- Button and form element sizing
- Image responsiveness
- Indexed accessibility

Screenshots demonstrating responsive design are present in views and templates section above.

### User Roles

I used AuthenticationForm and UserCreationForm as well as created a superuser to establish the access control of each user type:

- Visitors can register their account, and then they become a user. Account is then created in database securely. 

- Users can then log in, log out and use their full CRUD functionality for each task. Users can securely access only their dashboard and code ensures only admin can view or alter the content of each user's data.

- Admin user was set as superuser via django command, and has it's specific view from where they can manage all accounts and contents. Built in as well as manual safety measures are present to ensure code is only managed by the superuser/admin.

env.py file saves secret key and database url, .gitignore hides sensitive information about the project's code and databases, and debug is set to FALSE so no external agents can not view any custom errors. 

### JS testing procedures

### JavaScript Testing Procedures

JavaScript functionality was tested primarily for two key features:
- Action feedback messages display and timeout
- Past due date confirmation modal behavior

Test cases included:
- Message display timing and visibility
- Message content accuracy
- Modal trigger on past due date selection
- Modal button functionality (Yes/No/Close)
- Modal display and dismissal
- Cross-browser message compatibility
- Message stack behavior for multiple actions

### Modal Loading Issue Resolution

During testing, a critical issue was identified where the modal wasn't accessible on page load. The solution involved embedding the modal inside a conditional check:

<img src="static/images/testing/jsmodalerror.PNG" width="900px" alt="Modal Uncaught Error">

![modal original script](static\images\testing\jsmodal.PNG)

![modal fixed script](static\images\testing\jsmodalfixed.PNG)

This ensures the modal is only initialized when the form element exists, preventing JavaScript errors on pages where the form isn't present.


## Browser Compatibility
The application was tested across multiple browsers to ensure consistent functionality and appearance:

- Google Chrome (regular and incognito mode)
- Mozilla Firefox
- Microsoft Edge

All core features, including authentication, task management, responsive design, and JavaScript functionality, performed consistently across these browsers with no significant variations in behavior or appearance.

## Lighthouse

Here are the lighthouse reports for the site's main pages :
#### Homepage

Desktop | Mobile
:---: | :---:
![homepage](static\images\testing\lighthouse_imcognito100.PNG) | ![homepage](static\images\testing\lighthouse_mobile.PNG)


#### Todo List

Mobile | Performance Details
:---: | :---:
![Todo form](static\images\testing\lighthouse_mobile_newtask.PNG) | ![Todo form errors](static\images\testing\lighthouse_mobile_newtask_details.PNG)

Here it shows how performance drops for task form on mobile devices, slowing down the loading of resources. For future iterations inline Javascript will be tested as well as decreasing the dependancy on bootstrap.

## Online Validators

Several online validation tools were used to ensure code quality and standards compliance:

### HTML Validation
The W3C Markup Validation Service was used to verify HTML structure and syntax across all pages. Key validation steps included:

- Running each page URL through the validator to ensure no errors are present
- Checking template files individually

- Verifying proper nesting and closing of elements

 Any validation errors were promptly fixed during development. Upon fixing the errors, results showed valid HTML5 markup with only minor warnings that didn't affect functionality:

- No major errors found and now all of them fixed
- All elements properly nested
- Valid semantic structure
- Compliant meta tags and charset declarations

**HTML Validation Results**
**Homepage HTML Validation** | **Todo List HTML Validation**
:---: | :---:
![Homepage HTML Validation](static/images/testing/W3_no_errors.PNG) | ![Todo List HTML Validation](static/images/testing/W3_no_errors_todolist.PNG)

There's a persistent warning about the html aria labelling of my modal but I chose to leave it on for accessibility. Here it is:

<img src="static/images/testing/modalwarningW3.PNG" width="800px" alt="Modal Warning W3C">

### CSS Validation
- I copied my style.css code into the W3C Jigsaw CSS Validation Service  and verified stylesheet compliance
- No errors found in custom CSS code

**CSS Validation Results**

![CSS Validation Results](static\images\testing\w3css_no_errors.PNG)

### JavaScript Validation
- JSHint used to detect errors and potential problems

- No major errors were highlighted only bootstrap variables undefined but I did not act on it in order to not affect functionality.

- Code formatted according to standard style guidelines


**Javascript Validation Results**
    
![JS Hint validation](static/images/testing/jsvalidationfixed.PNG)

### Python Linting
- I installed Flake8 in my VS Code Workspace and checked each python file going over each of the errors and getting Copilot's assistance to fix indentation and spaces errors. 
- There are 2 indentation persistent errors which I later passed through CI online linter tool but still was not able to fix after trying many options. It does not affect the funtioning of the code so I let them be.

**Results**

Here's the only remaining errors I could not work out.


![Persistent Errors Views](static\images\testing\persistent_errors_views.PNG)

<img src="static/images/testing/persistent_errors_viewsCI_linter.PNG" width="800px" alt="Persistent Errors Views CI Linter">


### Accessibility
- My first point of reference to work with the accessibility of my app was Lighthouse reports.
- I used Stackflow to learn how to add tab index to my web application and ensured all important stops were added. However after running through lighthouse and wave I realised I had added too many and it was interfering with the flow of tab navigation.

- I changed the font family and the colour scheme of my site a few times to make it WCAG compliant.

I finally used WebAIM Contrast Checker verifto verify the color combination was the right one, much to my chagrin as the tone of green was important to the meaning, but I think it still makes it work. 

**Contrast Checker Results**

Failed | Passed
:---: | :---:
![Contrast Checker Failed](static/images/testing/contrastcheckerfail.png) | ![Contrast Checker Passed](static/images/testing/contrastcheckerpass.png)


- WAVE Web Accessibility Tool tested accessibility features and although it gave no further errors it gave lots of recommendations for improvements.

### User stories as testing tool

User stories served as an effective testing framework throughout development. Each story's acceptance criteria provided clear test cases to verify functionality. For example, the "create new task" story required testing task creation with various inputs, while the "delete task" story necessitated verification of both the deletion process and confirmation prompts. By systematically testing against user stories, I ensured that the implemented features met user requirements and worked as intended. This approach helped maintain focus on user needs while validating core functionality.

## Debugging

### Major debugging issue

### Major debugging challenges:

During development, several significant issues required debugging, as well as other minor fixes needed on a day to day basis. Here is an account of the main issues:

- Database Connection: Initial deployment faced database connection issues. Resolved by correctly configuring environment variables and database URLs.

- Static Files: Static files weren't loading properly in production. Fixed by updating STATIC_ROOT settings and implementing proper collectstatic commands.

- Form Submission: CSRF token validation errors occurred during form submissions. Fixed by ensuring proper middleware configuration and token inclusion.

- Message Display Issue:
Originally I tried to use toasts for messages but I could not connect them to my CRUD functions on database so they were just merely working on frontend.
I decided to use simple JavaScript to ensure messages were displayed and dismissed automatically. I had issues placing them in the right space until finally using css I managed to limit the view so they displayed discreetly and nicely at the top of main.

- Task Creation with Past Due Date:
Users could create tasks with due dates in the past without any confirmation.
I decided to kleep that functionality but added a confirmation dialog using JavaScript and bootstrap modal to prompt users when creating tasks with past due dates.
It was giving some errors which I fixed as explained in the JS section above.

- Form Validation:
Forms were not validating correctly, leading to giving  errors.
Ensured form validation logic is correctly implemented and provided feedback to users.

- Navigation Menu Toggle Button:
The navigation menu toggle button was not consistently white in all states.
It took a lot of CSS adjusting and overriding Bootstrap to ensure the toggle button and its icon remain white in all states.
It kept refusing so it took a lot of work, but great learning. 


- Logout Confirmation:
Problem: Users were logged out immediately without confirmation.
Solution: Added a logout confirmation page to prompt users before logging out.

## Reflection on the rol of AI in the development of the project

Copilot has been my main AI tool with the exception of a few debugging issues for which I used Chat GPT. 

I needed to be extremely discerning with Copilot and go back on my steps many times, specially when implementing bootstrap CSS features for styling. The responsiveness of the templated were really a difficult problem to fix and I ended up using a lot of my own css styling and learning how to over-ride the bootstrap rules that copilot had implemented in my code.

It often overcomplicates the code needed and creates changes without giving any notice. However I am very satisfied with the assistance it has provided and how much it has fortered my learning of coding.

The inline suggestions very often stood in the way creating snippets and especially HTML tags where they werent needed and momentarily breaking my code. 

I am still learning how to simplify the prompt so that it gives me exactly what I needed. At the early stages of the process it was a challenge to combine AI with the LMS walkthrough projects, and I ended up using imports we hadn't worked with before, as the Authentication used.
